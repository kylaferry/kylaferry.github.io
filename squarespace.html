<h2>My Journey With Squarespace</h2>


<p class="wordpic">I enjoyed my time with squarespace the most. It was fun to have full creative freedom over the design and layout of my website. I knew exactly what fake buisness I wanted to create a website for and had a clear vision in my head going into the project. While at times some tools were challanging to work with, I think I quickly learned the ins and outs of the software and crafted a professionl apeeling website. I would definetly consider using squarespace in the future if I ever need to create a website. Below is a run through video of my site.</p>
